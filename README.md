# farmers_collective
The project is a sub-part of a larger project under the Google AI for Social Good programme and is in
collaboration with IIT Delhi, Gram Vaani and CCD. <br>
Presently developing a tool using the ODK Collect Framework to introduce digitalization and help
overcome problems of the farmers. <br>
Later with the team, I will be exploring options to customize open source ERP tools to develop a digital
market for the farmers' cooperatives.
